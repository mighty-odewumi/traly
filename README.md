# Traly
Traly is a gentle revolution, a gamified platform that helps you finally take back control of your inbox, one email at a time.

No spam filters. No AI overlords. Just you, your choices, and a new way to interact with your inbox that’s rewarding, mindful, and even fun.

## How It Works
Traly turns email management into a game:

* Earn points for opening important emails
* Get rewarded for organizing, deleting, or unsubscribing
* Build streaks for staying on top of your inbox
* Unlock levels and badges as your inbox becomes your ally, not your enemy
* It’s not about how many emails you get, it’s about how intentionally you engage with them.

## Why Traly Matters
* Clarity replaces chaos
* Pride replaces procrastination
* Peace of mind replaces inbox anxiety
Traly helps you become more aware of where you submit your email, more selective with what you open, and more confident in your digital space.

No more mindless swiping. No more letting life pile up, unread.

## Privacy First
* Traly doesn’t read your emails.
* It doesn’t store your conversations.
* It simply honors your actions, and rewards your effort to take control. Everything stays safe, local, and in your hands.

- Traly is your personal inbox quest, helping you turn email chaos into a game of clarity, one point at a time.
